This diskette contains several directories named CHAPTER.xx. Each directory
contains one or more sample programs described on the equivalent xx chapter
of the Developing DCE Applications for AIX, OS/2 and Windows document.

There is also one directory named UTILS that contains some utilities to 
convert AIX text files to OS/2 text files and vice versa.

Some directories may have it's own README.TXT file. When you find a README 
file please read it prior to compile and run the samples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note for OS/2 users: IBM DCE for OS/2 supports HPFS and FAT file systems.
When installing IBM DCE for OS/2 development environment you can install
DCE include files for HPFS system and/or for FAT systems. The IDL 
compiler can also generate files with long filenames for HPFS systems and
short filenames for FAT systems. All samples in this diskette are using
filenames compatible with the HPFS environment. If your environment if
FAT you have to modify the name of the files generated by the IDL compiler
in all makefiles and the name of the include file generated by the IDL
compiler in each C source file.

Note for AIX users: An install script called INSTALL.AIX is provided
to help you in copying all files from this diskette into your AIX system.
Using dosread copy INSTALL.AIX from this diskette into your system.
Run it and all files and the directory structure contained in this
diskette will be duplicated in your system.

Note for Windows users: The APPENDIX directory contains  DCEWIN.H, LDCEWIN.LIB
and DCESHELL.EXE as well as their source code. Make sure DCEWIN.H is copied
into a directory in your INCLUDE path and LDCEWIN.LIB is copied into a
directory in your LIB path;
