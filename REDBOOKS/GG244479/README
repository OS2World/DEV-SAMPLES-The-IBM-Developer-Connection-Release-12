             SOMobjects: Management Utilities for Distributed SOM (DSOM)

The files on this diskette include the source and executable files 
described in the IBM Technical Bulletin "SOMobjects: Management Utilities 
for Distributed SOM (DSOM)" (GG24-4479).

These utilities are designed to work with Version 2.1 of the 
SOMobjects Developers Toolkit and Enablers.  They were written and tested
on OS/2 Warp and AIX V4.1.

NOTE: Some of these utilities require corrective service for SOM beforre 
they will run correctly.

The files on this diskette are:

     \aix\dsomutil.trz   <======= A compressed tar file.  Copy this
                                  file to an AIX 4.1 system as dsomutil.tar.Z.
                                  Use 'uncompress' to create the file
                                  'dsomutil.tar' and use the command
                                  'tar -xvf dsomutil.tar' to unpack the
                                  files.

     \os2\dsomutil.pak   <======= An OS/2 PACKed file containg the OS/2 version
                                  of the utilities.  Use the command 'itscinst'
                                  described below to unpack this file into the
