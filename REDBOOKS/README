Viewing LAN Systems Redbooks

RedBooks for LAN Systems are in BookManager form. They will have to
be viewed with the IBM Library Read/2 book viewer. If you do not
already have the viewer installed it is on the Developer Connection CD 
under Productivity Tools. During the install of Library Read/2 setup the 
drive letter for the CD-ROM to be accessed by Library Read/2.
