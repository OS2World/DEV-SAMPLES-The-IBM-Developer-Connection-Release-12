TRAPTRAP is a sample Trap catcher code using DosDebug.
Usage is

  TRAPTRAP [optional watch points] trapping_program arguments

optional watch points syntax is :
  /address1 [ /address2 [/address3 [ /address4 ]]]

where address1 (2,3,4) are the linear addresses to watch up to 4
addresses can be specified

sample provided use > TRAPTRAP TEST
where test.exe will trap

sample watch point provided use > TRAPTRAP /20000 WATCH
where watch.exe will write at linear address 20000
run 1st watch alone to check address.

it generates a PROCESS.TRP file similar to EXCEPTQ's
the stack limits pointed in the FS:0 area are not value due to a bug
in OS/2 see APAR PJ06136 that is why I dump all of the stack memory
object.
I did not test it with 16:16 code maybe a problem for the stack dump.
I did not include Disasm either as in EXCEPTQ.
