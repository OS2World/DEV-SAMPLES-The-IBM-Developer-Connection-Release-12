PMJRNDLL.DLL must be in one of your LIBPATH directories
Take a look at your CONFIG.SYS file to find which are these directories

LIBPATH=C:\;C:\CMLIB;C:\OS2\INSTALL;C:\OS2\DLL;

If you modify the program then use the MJ command to build
the pmjrn program but check in the .mak files
that the directories for your C compiler are the good ones

Enter PMJRN to start the journalling application

Good Luck
