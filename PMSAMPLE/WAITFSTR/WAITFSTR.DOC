This is a sample graphic engine hooking to wait for a string in any PM
window even from other processes, from a rexx function or C code.
GREHOOK is the graphic engine hook code, WAITFSTR is the 2/Rexx function
implementation to be called by the wait.cmd 2/Rexx sample.
 
Install the GREHOOK.DLL and WAITFSTR.DLL DLLs to a valid
DLL path (see LIBPATH).
Use EDITINI.EXE from EDITINI package to add the following entry
 
Application:  PM_ED_HOOKS
Key        :  GREHOOK            (Hook DLL name with no path no extension)
Data       :  Full qualified Path and name extension of GREHOOK.DLL where
              you installed it. eg: C:\WAITFSTR\GREHOOK.DLL
 
REBOOT
 
Then start wait.cmd, once started and waiting open an OS/2 window and
type in 'its me' the wait.cmd should exit saying Found.
