Move the gettext.DLL to a valid DLL path

See the gettext.CMD for the sample REXX to make the function work
(RxFuncAdd is mandatory once for a session)

Use WITT command to move the mouse over the field you want to get the
data from.
the call Gettext function.
Result is in the Text variable.

I provide this sample with source as a demonstration for coding REXX
functions.
Just adapt it to your own needs. If you feel functions you create may
be useful for the WITT community  make them requestable.

Sorry no Support is implied. (I work for the Networking Systems Division)
I do this on my own time
Enjoy It
