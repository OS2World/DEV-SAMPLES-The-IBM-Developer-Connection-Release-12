;***** This file contains instructions and a sample response file for the
;***** IBM LAN Distance Connection Server.
;*****
;*****
;***** This file will allow your users to install the IBM LAN Distance
;***** Connection Server with one step.
;*****
;***** Here are the steps:
;*****  1) Place the diskette images of the LAN Distance Connection Server
;*****     onto your LAN Server by typing the following command at the
;*****     OS/2 command prompt:
;*****
;*****       a:LDIMAGE /T:x:\yyyyyyyy
;*****
;*****          where:
;*****            a:LDIMAGE -- is the command from a drive (typically the A:
;*****                          drive where the LAN Distance diskette #1 is
;*****                          located) to start process.
;*****            /T: --------- is the Switch for installing the disk images.
;*****            x:\yyyyyyyy - is the location on the LAN Server (drive
;*****                          and path) where the disk images will be
;*****                          accessed by the LDIMAGE program.
;*****
;*****      You will then be prompted for the LAN Distance diskettes for
;*****      Drive A.
;*****
;*****
;*****   2) Create the Response File using the template below.  Place the
;*****      Response file in any subdirectory.
;*****
;*****
;*****   3) The user would then type the command:
;*****
;*****          x:\yyyyyyyy\INSTALL /R:n:\path\LD_SVR.RSP
;*****
;*****          where:
;*****            x:\yyyyyyyy - is the path to the LAN Distance
;*****                            diskette image #1.
;*****            INSTALL ----- is the command to start the Response
;*****                            file installation.
;*****             /R: -------- is the Switch for starting the
;*****                          Response File Installation process.
;*****                          (Without this value, the process becomes
;*****                           a re-directed installation over the LAN.)
;*****             n:\path ---- is the path to the Response file
;*****             LD_SVR.RSP-- is the name of the Response file.
;*****                          (This can be any file name you wish.)
;*****
;*****        No message is displayed while the response file installation
;*****        progresses.  This type of installation takes several minutes.
;*****        No other activity can occur for this workstation while this
;*****        installation is progressing.  During the installation process
;*****        the focus will be at the OS/2 Workplace, however, once the
;*****        installation process completes, focus will return to the command
;*****        prompt from which the initial command was entered.
;*****
;*****        Please shut-down and re-start the workstation for the updates
;*****        to take effect.
;*****
;*****        For more information regarding the use and syntax of re-directed
;*****        installations and response file installation, please refer to
;*****        the LAN Distance System Guide.

Target = D:\

;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
; Note:   This value is not required.  A default will be supplied that will
;         use the boot drive if this value is not specified on the command
;         line.  This drive must be local to the user's workstation.

;

WorkStationType = SERVER
;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
; Note:   This value is optional for the LAN Distance Connection Server.
;         The WorkStationType parameter is ignored when the installation is
;         for the Connection Server.  However, in order to avoid possible
;         confusion with the LAN Distance Remote workstation response file
;         installation, you may wish to include this value in the LAN Distance
;         Connection Server response file installation.
