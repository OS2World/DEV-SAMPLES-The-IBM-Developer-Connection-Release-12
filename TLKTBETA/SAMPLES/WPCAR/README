  This README document contains information that describes how the
  Beta .IDL files for the Workplace Shell are to be used.

  These files are pre-release versions and are provided on an as-is basis
  for evaluation and demonstration.  They are not intended for use with
  production code.

  The files included in this beta have been provided for evaluation by
  developers who have the SOMobjects Toolkit* and want to write their
  Workplace Shell subclasses using the Interface Definition Language
  (IDL) described in the SOMobjects Toolkit.

To build and install the Car sample in this directory:

1) edit the makefile so that it pertains to your environment

   Make sure that the beta Workplace Shell idls and headers are in your INCLUDE and
   SMINCLUDE paths as necessary.

2) nmake -f car.mak

3) register class and create instance using either the Workplace Class
   List or via a REXX script.
