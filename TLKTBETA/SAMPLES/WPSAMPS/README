  This README document contains information that describes how the
  Beta .IDL files for the Workplace Shell are to be used.

  These files are pre-release versions and are provided on an as-is basis
  for evaluation and demonstration.  They are not intended for use with
  production code.

  The files included in this beta have been provided for evaluation by
  developers who have the SOMobjects Toolkit* and want to write their
  Workplace Shell subclasses using the Interface Definition Language
  (IDL) described in the SOMobjects Toolkit.


The following classes demonstrate the following:

DRAGEXAM and DRAGFOLD: together, these two classes illustrate how
to create a class (DRAGEXAM) whose objects can only be dropped on
objects of class DRAGFOLD.

MYFOLDER: this separate class demonstrates how to manipulate an object's
USEITEM list so that you have control over, for example, what open views
of an object are to be closed on demand.

This class also behaves such that upon first opening a MYFOLDER folder,
any subfolders that may reside in the folder are deleted.  This may be
useful if you wanted to have a folder delete certain of its contents upon
the first open after a boot.

MAKEFILE - builds each class into a separate DLL.  You will have to edit the
           makefile to customize it to your development environment.

INSTALL.CMD - copies the DLLs and SYMs to C:\OS2\DLL, and creates an instance
              of each of the three classes on the desktop.  Edit this file
              if your boot drive is not C:
